The previous AI engineer initiated the development of a PYME management application. The process began with understanding the user's high-level request, followed by a clarification of specific business needs, such as managing sales orders, invoicing, purchases, delivery notes, and financial summaries, explicitly excluding inventory control. The AI engineer then formulated a phased development plan. The initial phase focused on setting up the base project structure, defining data models (Pedidos, Facturas, Compras, Remitos, Clientes), and outlining basic API endpoints and frontend navigation. The work progressed to verifying the existing backend structure by reading . The last action indicates the intention to implement the core system, including adding frontend dependencies for charting, suggesting the next step involves writing the initial code for the defined models and UI.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a management application for their small and medium-sized enterprise (PYME). The core problem to solve is the need for a comprehensive system to manage business operations, specifically focusing on financial and order-based transactions rather than inventory.

Explicit requests and features include:
*   **Sales Management:** Handling sales that are orders that are manufactured and shipped by transport with a delivery receipt (comprobante de remito), not over-the-counter sales.
*   **Invoicing:** Generating and archiving sales invoices.
*   **Purchase Management:** Recording and archiving purchases and expenses.
*   **Financial Control:** A dashboard to monitor sales, expenses, and profits (ventas - gastos = ganancias).
*   **Delivery Notes (Remitos):** Issuing delivery receipts for shipments.

Explicit non-requirements:
*   No need for stock or inventory control of raw materials or merchandise.

The application is being built as a full-stack web application with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. The initial implementation aims to establish the core data models and basic CRUD operations, along with a foundational UI and a basic financial dashboard.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development:** React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **UI Frameworks:** Tailwind CSS for styling, Shadcn UI components for pre-built, modern UI elements.
-   **API Design:** FastAPI with  prefix for all backend routes.
-   **Environment Variables:** Strict usage of  and .
-   **Deployment:** Kubernetes container environment, supervisor for process management.
-   **Data Modeling:** JSON serializable UUIDs instead of MongoDB ObjectIDs.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with separate frontend and backend directories.



**Detailed Directory Structure and Key Files:**

*   
    *   : Lists Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend.
    *   : The main FastAPI application file. This file will contain the database connection, API routes, and business logic for managing orders, invoices, purchases, and clients. The AI engineer read this file, indicating it's the primary target for backend code generation.
    *   : Contains environment variables, specifically  for database connection.

*   
    *   : Node.js dependencies (e.g., React, Tailwind CSS) and scripts.
    *   : Configuration for Tailwind CSS.
    *   : PostCSS configuration for styling.
    *   : Contains environment variables, specifically  for backend API calls.
    *   : Static assets for the React application.
    *   : React source code.
        *   : The entry point for the React application.
        *   : The main React component where the application's layout and routing will be defined. It is intended to be rewritten by .
        *   : Component-specific styles. Intended to be rewritten.
        *   : Global styles, including Tailwind CSS base layers and custom CSS variables for themes (light/dark mode).
        *   : Contains pre-built Shadcn UI components (e.g., , , , , etc.) that are mandated for use in the frontend.

The architecture emphasizes clear separation of concerns, environment variable usage for configuration, and leveraging pre-built UI components for rapid development. The AI engineer plans to use  to create/rewrite , , and  in a single pass to quickly establish the core application.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had finished understanding the user's detailed requirements for the PYME management application. The previous engineer then laid out a comprehensive three-phase plan to develop the application, covering base structure, core functionalities, and advanced features like delivery notes and detailed reports.

The last completed action was:
-   Reading the content of  to understand its existing structure and ensure the database setup and CORS handling remain intact during future rewrites. The observation output for  was truncated but confirmed the file's presence and initial structure.

The AI engineer's thought process concluded with the decision to begin the implementation, specifically noting the need to add dependencies for charting in the frontend, which indicates the next immediate step involves preparing the frontend environment for the planned dashboard features.
